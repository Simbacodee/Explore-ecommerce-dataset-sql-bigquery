🔍 Observation  
In June 2017, the **(direct)** channel generated the highest overall revenue, reaching over **$97,333**, followed by **Google** ($18,757) and **dfa** ($8,862). On a weekly level, direct traffic maintained its dominance consistently, particularly during **Week 24** and **Week 25**, where it peaked at over **$30,908** and **$27,295**, respectively. Other sources like **mail.google.com**, **dfa**, and **google.com** also showed noticeable contributions across multiple weeks, indicating a mix of high-performing paid and organic traffic sources.

### 4. Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, July 2017
